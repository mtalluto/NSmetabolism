# NSmetabolism
R-package for n-station metabolism model

17 Jan, branch feat/ns_cpp
Deleted ALL deprecated functions, all calibration except one station, everything that is not done or not needed, in order to start fresh with an attempt to run the ns model GIVEN a set of params and known data

goal here is to write an OO C++ program that does this

- start with pixels
- then reaches
- then a network


will also need conversion wrappers to convert from R objects (including a watershed)



A LOT of old code is in inst/maybe keep
