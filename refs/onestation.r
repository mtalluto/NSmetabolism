# these are kept for historical significance

# should be able to integrate properly across any measurement period


# oxyfile has the empirical data: original times and measured oxygen values (determine the fitting quality of the model) and observed values for forcing functions light and temp
# parameters P1, P2 and ER24 [MET] are estimated by minimizing the negative log likelihood. 
# optionally K600 is fixed (and is an exchange velocity, not a rate!).
